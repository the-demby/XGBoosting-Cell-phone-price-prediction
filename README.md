# XGBoosting-Cell-phone-price-prediction



Bob, a young entrepreneur who started his own mobile phone company, 
wants to fight hard against big companies like Apple, Samsung, etc.
However, he does not know how to estimate the price of the mobiles created by his 
company and absolutely cannot rely on simple assumptions in this competitive 
mobile telephony market. To solve his problem, he collects cell phone sales data 
from various companies and calls on us for our expertise in machine learning.
Our work will therefore be to highlight the existing relationship between the characteristics 
of a mobile phone (for example: - RAM, internal memory, etc.) and its selling price on the 
market.
In this problem, we are not going to predict the real price of mobile phones, but 
rather a simple price range indicating how high the real prices can be.
To do this we will use a machine learning model called XGBoost.
